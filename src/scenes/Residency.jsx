            Financial Guarantee
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10">
            A non cancelable indemnity or surety bond backed by an insurance
            company, which guarantees that principal and interest will be paid
            in compliance with the contractual agreement or promissory note.
            Financial guarantee loans are used by debt issuers as a way of
            attracting lenders
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10">
            The guarantee provides said lenders with an additional level of
            security that the loan will be repaid/obligation will be fulfilled
            in the event that the securities issuer is unable to do so. The loan
            may benefit the principal by enhancing the principal’s
            creditworthiness thereby lowering the cost of financing
          </p>

          <p className="mt-10">
            The guarantee “wraps” the loan with the insurer’s good name and
            creditworthi- ness. Because the bond represents an UNCONDITIONAL
            GUARANTEE of compliance/repayment, a preferred interest rate is
            often offered to lenders
